This file describes how you can resolve error messages like the following one:

!!!!! OpenGL Error !!!!! invalid enumerant - occurred before /path/to/file.c:lineNumber

kuhl_errorcheck() prints these messages whenever there is an OpenGL
error somewhere earlier in the program. The file and line number in
the message correspond to the exact kuhl_errorcheck() call where the
error was detected.

Here are the steps for resolving these errors:

1) Call kuhl_errorcheck() more frequently in your program so that you
eventually have:

    kuhl_errorcheck(); // <-- doesn't print an error
    glSomething();
    kuhl_errorcheck(); // <-- does print an error

2) Find documentation for the glSomething() function that must be
causing the error. Look for a section labeled "Errors" in the document
to find a list of one or more things that could cause the error that
you are encountering

IMPORTANT: It isn't necessarily the case that the error is in the same
filename that is in the error message. The filename and line number in
the message just mean that the error occurred sometime before that
line of code.
