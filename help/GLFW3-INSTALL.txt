IMPORTANT: GLFW 3.1.2 (October 2015) or higher is required.

=== Linux installation ===

On recent Ubuntu installations (16.04, for example), you can install
GLFW3 by installing the libglfw3 and libglfw3-dev packages.


=== Mac OS X installation ===

Install glfw via homebrew.

=== Windows installation ==

Download a precompiled version (we recommend the 32-bit version).

Alternatively, download the GLFW3 source, run cmake-gui and set the
source code location and the place to build the binaries to the root
directory of the GLFW3 source. Click configure, then generate. Then
open the solution in Visual Studio and compile the library.


=== Compiling GLFW yourself on Linux or Mac OS X ===

If none of the options above work for you, you can download and compile GLFW yourself.

Download the source for GLFW: http://www.glfw.org/download.html

Unzip the source code.

Make sure cmake is installed.

Run "cmake ." to create makefiles

Run "make" to compile the library

Next, use one of the following two options:
 1) Run "sudo make install" to install GLFW into /usr/local/include/GLFW and /usr/local/lib
 2) In CMakeLists.txt for the example OpenGL programs included in this package, set the glfw_src_path variable to the path to the GLFW source.
