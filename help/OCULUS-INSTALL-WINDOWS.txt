To install Oculus SDK 1.5+, please follow these steps.

0. Verify that you can run triangle.exe normally.

1. Install Oculus Runtime (if you haven't already)

2. Download the Oculus SDK 1.5+ from the website (1.5/1.6 were tested to work): 
https://developer.oculus.com/

3. Open the appropriate LibOVR vcxproj file using Visual Studio. To do this, navigate
to opengl-libs/OculusSDK/LibOVR/Projects/Windows/VS2015 (or similar) and open the vcxproj file.
Then, build LibOVR.

4. Open cmake-gui for the opengl-examples folder. Click "File | Delete cache". Then click the 
"configure" button and confirm that it reports that it "Found OVR". Then click "generate".

5. Reopen the opengl-examples project in Visual Studio, when prompted reload the files from 
disk. Try to rebuild the triangle solution again to confirm that the compilation process works.

6. Run "triangle.exe --config ../config/oculus.ini" to confirm that the triangle program
works with your Oculus.
