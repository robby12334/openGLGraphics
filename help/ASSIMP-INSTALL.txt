--- SELECTING AN ASSIMP VERSION ---

If you want to use ASSIMP you should use the following versions: 

   - Version 3.1.1 or higher is recommended.
   
   - The latest version at the time of this writing, 4.0.1, works on
     Linux and Mac but has received little testing. I have received no
     reports of if 4.0.1 works on Windows (it should, let us know if
     it does work).


--- LINUX INSTRUCTIONS ---

First try installing ASSIMP via your distributions package manager. On
many systems, you will need to install both the library and the
associated headers (for example libassimp3 and libassimp-dev).

If you decide to compile it yourself:
Download it from the website listed above
Extract files
cmake .
make

If you encounter problems compiling assimp 3.2, try changing "cmake ."
to "cmake -DASSIMP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF ."

Next, use one of the following two options:
 1) Run "sudo make install" to install ASSIMP into /usr/local
 2) Edit opengl-examples/CMakeModules/FindASSIMP.txt so that this software can find your copy of the library.


--- macOS INSTRUCTIONS ---

Install homebrew and run "brew install assimp"


--- WINDOWS INSTRUCTIONS ---

Download ASSIMP source code (we've tested with ASSIMP 3.2 and 3.3; if you confirm that a newer version works, let us know!). Ensure that you have CMake and Visual Studio installed.

Run cmake-gui

Set the root directory of the ASSIMP source code to be "where is the source code:" and "where to build the binaries:".

Click "Configure". Select Visual Studio and native compilers.

Click "Generate".

Open "Assimp.sln" with Visual Studio.

Right click on the "assimp" solution and select "Build". If you try to build the ALL_BUILD solution and didn't set ASSIMP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF in cmake, then ALL_BUILD may not work correctly.

Refer back to WINDOWS-VisualStudio.txt to get opengl-examples to work with your library.
