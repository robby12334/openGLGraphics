You can find GLEW at: http://glew.sourceforge.net/


--- SELECTING A GLEW VERSION ---

This code should work with any recent version of GLEW. At least one
person has confirmed that glew 1.13.0 works with this code.


--- LINUX INSTRUCTIONS ---

First try installing GLEW via your distributions package manager. On
many systems, you will need to install both the library and the
associated headers (for example libglew and libglew-dev).

If you decide to compile it yourself:
Download it from the website listed above.
Extract files.
cmake .
make

Next, use one of the following two options:
 1) Run "sudo make install" to install GLEW into /usr/include/GL/ and /usr/lib/
 2) Edit opengl-examples/CMakeModules/FindGLEW.txt so that this software can find your copy of the library.


--- OSX INSTRUCTIONS ---

Install homebrew and run "brew install glew".


--- WINDOWS INSTRUCTIONS ---

Download GLEW (we've tested with GLEW 1.13.0). It is already compiled for you!

Refer back to WINDOWS-VisualStudio.txt to get opengl-examples to work with your library.
